- 💼 I'm currently teaching Data Science in San Antonio, with a background in wellness tech.

- 🗄️ My work has been focused in A/B testing, recommendation engines, reporting & insights, and ELT pipelines using Python, R, SQL, Tableau, PySpark, and AWS resources.

- 🌱 I'm currently working to obtain my AWS Solutions Architect certification to widen my deployment abilities and combine with my Machine Learning skillset.
  
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on research based/exploratory projects in computer vision.
